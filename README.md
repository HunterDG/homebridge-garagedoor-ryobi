# homebridge-garagedoor-ryobi

[Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin that supports opening and **closing a single** Ryobi garagedoor opener.

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-garagedoor-command`
3. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.

## Configuration

Configuration sample:

```json
"accessories": [
  {
    "accessory": "RyobiGarageCommand",
    "name"     : "Garage Door",
    "email"    : "RYOBI_EMAIL",
    "password" : "RYOBI_PASSWORD"
  }
]

```
## Explanation:

Field                   | Description
------------------------|------------
**accessory**                  | (**required**) Must be "RyobiGarageCommand" 
**name**                          | (**required**) Pick the defaukt garage door name for the home app
**email** 			   | (**required**) email associate with your garage doors ryobi account 
**password**	                  | (**required**) password associate with your garage doors ryobi account 
**poll_short_delay**         | (**Default is 15 seconds** ) Polling status (in seconds) while garage door is opening and closing. Min value 15;  
**poll_long_delay**          | (**Default is 90 seconds** ) Time between polling for the garage door's state.  Outside of opening and closing. Min value >= poll_short_delay;
**garagedoor_id**        |  (**recommend NOT setting**) defaults correctly, **see below**
**debug_sensitive**    |  (**recommend NOT setting**) defaults to  false **see below**.

## debug_sensitive

To debug server requests/responses I need to log lots of sensitive data--not my fault, the server responses include sensitve data scattered. The responses contain from the server Account Names, API keys, and DeviceIDs. You don't want this scatered in homebridge log files on your machine or mailed to other folks that need your homebridge log files for other reasons. Currently I can't prevent this because the API I have to get the the door state requires your login and passord--not an api key. This is very unfortunate. A  `debug_sensitive parameter`  config parament is available and should normally always be false--the default. You have been warned. Had this not been the case I would have used and `apiKey` and the `deviceid` rather than your password in the config file.

The sensivite data is ONLY logged when this config setting is true **and** when debugging homebridge itself: ` DEBUG=* homebridge -D -P`

## poll_short_delay and poll_long_delay
After setting sendong the opening/closing command to ryobi, it rill returning the original state for the next 0-13 seconds. When I get the state back I actually can't tell if the door is infact remainging in the original state because of a problem or just hasent starting opening yet (and in fact it may already be in the desired state.)  The code will work OK but the result of this is that the short poll delay thinks it is no longer needed and goes into long polling mode which will eventually fix the door state. So I set a min 15 seconds on the short delay to fix this. The code that I forked from just slammed the sate to the final state to get around this, I thought that was wrong, I'd rather leave the state as opening/closing until I really know the final state. I don't want to false report a door as closed when it is not.

If the door state accorind to ryobi is every opening or closing I will use the short polling time until the door is out of that state.

## garagedoor_id

**If you leave **garagedoor_id** out the config file the right thing should happen.**

If you can have multiple garage doors associated with an account (is this possible?) then maybe pass in the id using the instructions below. I mainly added it to the config file while I was developing and thought it might be useful. Sorry for any confustions if it is not. 

In a browser (I recommend using FireFox because it automatically formats the json result) execute:

`https://tti.tiwiconnect.com/api/devices?username=RYOBI_ACCOUNT_EMAIL&password=RYOBI_PASSORD`

You will get an array of results, if you have only 1 device (like me) the devide id will be **`result[0].varName`** except if result[0].deviceTypeIds[1] == `gda500hub` then use **`result[1].varName`** .

## homebridge log entries:

In the normal course of running you will see the log stuff like this (with out the  `^^^^^`  comments.).

## Security concerns and help wanted

I have a file 'notes.txt' that shows the APIs. If your interested in solving these concerns of mine please help. I believe that the current APIs were reversed engiueered by yannipang, you can see the sorce website below.

### Would like to get the device status with an APIKEY and DEVICE ID.
I want to get rid of using passwords and would rather have an APIKEY and DEVICE ID in the config file and pprovice instructions to the user to obtain them and put in the config file. The issue is that to get the satus I need the password. SInce I need that password for that case the code just grabs the key and device id.

The key is used when sending an actual command.

### The name and password is in the request parameters when getting the status and device ID, they are in post data (a little better) when getting the api key.

I dont' like this data in the URL's becuase I don't trust that the not just logged in clear text on the ryobi servers. I've tried to change things to post request with data but then I get errors.

I am standing on the shoulders of others.

## FAQ

### Can I have multiple garage doors?
You add additional accessories, with accounts and passwords, in the homebrige configjson file. 
If however you can have multiple openeris associated with one login then for now you arfe out of luck.

### Why use a password and not an apiKey of sorts?
A password is unfortunately required to get the open/close state of the garage door and to fetch the doorid. I don't like it but that's the way it is. Sorry.

### can I do other things with my garage door?
Well I can in code. ðŸ˜œ For example I can control the light--that code is not exposed in anyway. It would have to be a seperate accessory. Too much work for a hobby.
